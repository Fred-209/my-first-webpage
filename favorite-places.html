    <h1>My Favorite Places</h1>
    <p>We all have favorite places to go, and here are a few of mine.</p>
    <br>

    <p>There are plenty of great places to hike and fish. The Charon Gardens
      Wildernes area is my favorite hiking area.</p>

    <h2><em>Fort Stockton, Texas</em></h2>

      of Paisano Pete, giant fake roadrunner">
    <p>Fort Stockton, Texas, is a small town in west Texas.
      <br>
      I grew up here, which is the only reason this is listed as one of my favorite
      places.
      <br>
       While the scenery is great if you enjoy empty desert, mesas, and mesquite trees
      (which I do), there is not a lot for one to do there entertainment wise.
